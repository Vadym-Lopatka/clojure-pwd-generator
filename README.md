# pwd-generator

Сommand-line tool for password generation.

- generates a password of a given length (12 by default) 
- copies the result to the clipboard
- prints the result to the console 

## Usage

Run the project with default password length(12):

    $ clojure -M:run-m 
    Generated password is: 9+3'=A.@e3,7

Run the project with custom password length via `-l` option:

    $ clojure -M:run-m -l 8 
    Generated password is: w2PGeT4G

## Uberjar build
Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the uberjar in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it. The `ci` task will
still generate a minimal `pom.xml` as part of the `uber` task, unless you remove `version`
from `build.clj`.

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/pwd-generator-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -l 10

If you remove `version` from `build.clj`, the uberjar will become `target/pwd-generator-standalone.jar`.
